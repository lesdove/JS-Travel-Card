## JS Travel Card Final Project: A live medical card for international travel.
# Medical records and personal information are understandably heavily protected but in a traveling situation it is especially important that individuals have access to their most up-to-date medical information. With this tool patients select personal information they would like to make visible, then their most up-to-date medical information displays on their phone screensaver or digital smartphone Wallet.

Technologies used and Topics Applied: The transition from selecting the items to then having those items displayed after hitting submit was especially challenging. I saw examples of how to run the transition through the index, style and script documents but wanted to challenge myself by focusing on the Javascript file. I was most excited about Part 2 of the textbook where we started learning about web pages. I also enjoyed refreshing on loops which I first learned in Python and wanted to use in my checkbox function. 

# Why this project? 
With this interface, patients choose what information they share from emergency contacts, chronic diseases and geographically relevant immunization information. The information can be easily adjusted based on how comfortable the patient is with sharing their information in their current setting (especially on risky vacation adventures). Most importantly, and ideally medical professionals would have advanced privileges to access more of the life-saving information via the cloud. This brings me to how else I would improve this application:

* The obvious build would be cloud integration that makes the information current unlike the existing medical card applications that are not synched to medical records. 

* Language Geolocation - the text in the card changes to match the dominant language of the region or spoken language of the cards accessor. 

* As I finish my Cloud Security course I would build on this project by outlining how to increase security of the PII by using advanced security features in cloud platforms, like activity monitoring, that would also account for if the phone appears to be stolen. 

* Scan QR feature: The user can access their travel buddies' information when needed. From home they can keep tabs on traveling loved ones using the app. Most importantly, and my reason for this idea, medical professionals globally could also access information on the patient  using a special access code.
  
* Synching applications:
  Calendar- to update travel information
  Airbnb- to update lodging information automatically
  WhatsApp- international communication and contacts for non-roaming use in an emergency
