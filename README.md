## Travel Card Final Project: A live medical card for international travel.
# Medical records and personal information are understandably heavily protected but in a traveling situation it is especially important that individuals have access to their most up-to-date medical information. With this tool patients select personal information they would like to make visible, then their most up-to-date medical information displays on their phone background or smartphone digital Wallet.

Cloud Components: This project sets out to demonstrates how cloud storage can be used to keep medical record information on patients secure, accessible abroad, and up-to-date in a visual wallet. I wanted to further demonstrate how to increase security of the Protected Health Information (PHI) by enabling advanced security features in AWS, like activity monitoring.  

# Why this project? 
As a frequent solo traveler, I am always worried for my safety and have to consider how I would navigate my care in an emergency situation. With this interface, patients choose what information they share from emergency contacts, chronic diseases to geographically relevant immunization information. The information can be easily adjusted based on how comfortable the patient is with sharing in their current setting (especially on risky vacation adventures). I also envision how medical professionals would have advanced privileges to access more of the life-saving information via the cloud. This brings me to how else I would improve this application:

* Remote card removal: If the phone appears to be stolen, patients are able to disable the medical card information via a friend's wallet card

* Language Geolocation: The text in the card changes to match the dominant language of the region or spoken language of the cards accessor. 

* Scan QR feature: The user can access their travel buddies' information when needed. From home they can keep tabs on traveling loved ones using the app. Additionally, medical professionals globally could also access information on the patient using a special access code.
  
* Synching applications:
  Calendar- to update travel information
  Airbnb- to update lodging information automatically
  WhatsApp- international communication and contacts for non-roaming use in an emergency
