## JS Travel Card Final Project- A live medical card for international travel.
Medical records and personal infromation are understandibly heavily protected but in a traveling situation it is especially important that individuals have the access to their most up-to-date medical information. Patients should be able to access this information more publically and efficiently. 

Intended use: For patients to have their medical information readily avaiable as they travel. using a dropdown menu to make their selections, they now have up-to-date medical information displayed on their phone screensaver or digital smartphone Wallet.

Why?: With this interface, patients choose what information they share from emergency contacts, chronic diseases and geographically relevent immunization information. The information can be easily adjusted based on how comfortable the patient is with sharing their information in the current setting (especially on risky vacartion adventures). Most importantly, medical professionals would have advanced privileges to access life-saving information via the cloud. 

Furute Buiilds: 
* The obvious build would be cloud integration that makes the information current unlike the existing medical card applications. 

* Language Geolocation - the text in the card changes to match the dominant language of the region or spoken langugae of the cards accessor 

* As I finish my Cloud Security course I would build on this project by outlining how to increase security of the PII by using advanced security features in cloud platforms, like activity monitoring, and even accounting for if the phone appears to be stolen 

* Scan QR to expand feature: The user can connect to other medical cards and access their travel buddys' information when needed. From home they can keep tabs on traveling loved ones using the app. Most importantly, and my reason for this idea, medical professionals can also access information on the patient universally using a secret access code.
  
* Synching applications:
  Calendar- to update travel information
  Airbnb- to update lodging information automatically
  What's App- international communication and contacts for non-roaming use in an emergency
