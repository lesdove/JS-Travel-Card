## JS Travel Card Final Project- A live medical card for international travel.
# This project is a culmination of:
~ My love of Travel  
~ Making PPI accessible to healthcare professionals universally
~ Promotion of Cloud-Based Storage high accessibility 

...Along with my desire to challenge my JavaScript programming abilities. 

Regulations in healthcare protects patients' Personally Identifiable Information. I am interested in improving how individuals can opt into how much of this information is accessed publically and efficiently. 
Medical records and personal infromation are understandibly heavily protected but in a traveling situation it is especially important that individuals have the access to their most up-to-date medical information. 

Intended use: Patients have up-to-date medical information from the cloud that they can choose from to display in a dropdown menu. Once their choices have been selected they can set the information as their phone screensaver so it is easily accessible or create a digital smartphone Wallet card. 
With this interface, patients choose what infromation they would like to be displayed from basic information like emergency contacts to chronic diseases and relevent immunization information. The information can be easily adjusted based on how comfortable (or how necessary in risky environments) the patient is with sharing their information in the current setting. Medical Professionals would have advanced privileges to access life-saving information via the cloud. 


Furute Buiilds: 
The obvious build would be the cloud integration that makes the information current unlike the current medical card applications. 
Language Geolocation - the text in the card changes to match the dominant language of the region or spoken langugae of the card accessor 
As I finish my Cloud Security course I would build on this project by outlining how to increase security of the PII by using advanced security features in cloud platforms and even if the phone appears to be stolen 
Scan to view feature: The user can connect to other medical cards and access their travel partner's information when needed, they can keep tabs on traveling loved ones using the app. Most importantly, and my reason for this idea, medical professionals can also access information on the patient universally using a secret access code.
Potential connection of applications:
  Calendar- to update travel information
  Airbnb- to update lodging information automatically
  What's App- international communication and contacts for non-roaming use in an emergency
